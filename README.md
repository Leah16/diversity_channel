What is Diversity Channel?

Characteristics of this project

A support tool for people with foreign roots to work healthily and safely in Japan
We are developing a "Diversity Channel" to support people with foreign roots to work healthily and safely in Japan.

We are working to ensure that everyone has safe and secure access to the medical and nursing care they need, transcending language barriers, healthcare system barriers, and educational barriers.
